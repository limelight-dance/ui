          <p>
            Limelight Dance Club was founded on October 10th, 2015 by a group of talented dancers from the KW region of Ontario, Canada. We are a student-run, non-profit dance club. We make dance cover videos and offer free weekly dance tutorials. We also perform at various events, including Toronto K-pop Concert, Waterloo Chinese New Year, Annual Community All Style Battle, Fashion for Change Holiday Showcase and more. In 2017, we won 1st place at the Toronto K-pop World Festival hosted by the Korean Consulate and UTKSA. And also ranked within the top 10 K-pop cover groups in Canada. We are passionate about what we do, and we are GOOD at what we do. We are a group born to perform under the spotlight. We are number one.
